You are a senior SEO + frontend engineer. Generate a complete, production-ready HTML file named index.html for a GitHub Pages site.

Hard requirements:
- Clean semantic HTML5 + modern CSS (in <style>) + minimal vanilla JS only if needed.
- Mobile-first, fast, accessible (WCAG-friendly).
- Include a hero section with an image at the top (use <picture> + <img>), properly sized, with width/height, loading="eager" for the hero, decoding="async", fetchpriority="high".
- Use this image path exactly: [IMAGE_PATH]
- Add strong on-page SEO:
  - <title> (70 chars max)
  - meta description (155-160 chars)
  - canonical URL (must match the page URL)
  - Open Graph + Twitter meta tags (og:title, og:description, og:url, og:image, twitter:card)
  - JSON-LD structured data for Article (or CollectionPage if it's a hub page)
- Create a premium dark-tech travel editorial design (not flashy, clean, high trust).
- Include:
  - Header with site name "TripGuidely" + nav links: Cruises, Hotels, Things to Do
  - Breadcrumbs matching the folder path
  - Main content with:
    - H1 matching the page intent
    - Short intro
    - Table of contents with anchor links
    - 6–10 sections with helpful, non-generic content
    - FAQ section (5–8 Q&As) using FAQPage JSON-LD too (in addition to the page schema)
  - Internal links to the other pages (use these exact URLs):
    - /cruises/
    - /cruises/best-cruises-2026/
    - /hotels/best-hotels-paris/
    - /things-to-do/rome/
- Add a footer with last updated date placeholder.

Output:
- Return ONLY the full HTML code (no explanations).
Variables to use:
- Page URL: [PAGE_URL]
- Page title: [PAGE_TITLE]
- Meta description: [META_DESCRIPTION]
- Hero image: [IMAGE_PATH]
- OG image: use [IMAGE_PATH] unless an /assets/images/og/ version exists.
