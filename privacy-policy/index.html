          <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span id="lastUpdated">2026-02-27</span></p>

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how TripGuidely (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you visit
            <strong>tripguidely.github.io</strong> (the “Site”).
          </p>

          <h2>1) Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            We try to collect as little personal information as possible. Depending on how you use the Site, we may collect:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic usage data</strong> (pages visited, approximate location, device/browser, referral source).</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction data</strong> (for example, when you click outbound links).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical data</strong> (IP address may be processed for security/analytics, but we configure analytics to reduce identifiability where possible).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2) Analytics (Google Analytics 4)</h2>
          <p>
            We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to understand how visitors use the Site and to improve content and navigation.
            We configured GA4 to be more privacy-friendly by disabling Google signals and ad personalization signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Analytics data may include: pages viewed, scroll/engagement signals, approximate region, device type, and traffic source.
          </p>

          <h2>3) Outbound link tracking</h2>
          <p>
            To understand which resources are useful, we may measure <strong>outbound link clicks</strong> (clicks to websites outside TripGuidely).
            This event can include the destination URL as an event label.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use this only for performance measurement and content improvement (for example: which booking resources people actually use).
          </p>

          <h2>4) Affiliate links</h2>
          <p>
            Some links on the Site may be affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase or booking,
            we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more details, see our <a href="/disclosure/">Affiliate Disclosure</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>5) Third-party scripts and partners</h2>
          <p>
            The Site may load third-party scripts that support affiliate verification and monetization (for example Travelpayouts tools),
            as well as analytics scripts (Google tag / GA4).
          </p>

          <p>
            These third parties may process data according to their own policies. We recommend reviewing their policies if you want more detail:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google (Analytics / Google tag)</li>
            <li>Travelpayouts (affiliate tools)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6) Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            The Site may use cookies or similar technologies from analytics and affiliate partners.
            Cookies can help measure performance, prevent fraud, and support attribution for affiliate programs.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can control cookies through your browser settings. Blocking cookies may affect certain site features and tracking accuracy.
          </p>

          <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser controls:</strong> You can block or delete cookies using your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some browsers send DNT signals. The Site may not respond consistently to DNT signals.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We keep analytics data only as long as needed for reporting, trend analysis, and site improvement.
            Retention and processing may also depend on third-party platform settings.
          </p>

          <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
          </p>

          <h2>10) Security</h2>
          <p>
            We take reasonable steps to protect the Site and its data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
          </p>

          <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top of the page will reflect changes.
          </p>

          <h2>12) Contact</h2>
          <p>
