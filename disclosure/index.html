          <p>
            TripGuidely participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means that some of the links on this website are affiliate links.
          </p>

          <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
          <p>
            If you click on an affiliate link and make a booking or purchase, we may earn a small commission. 
            This comes at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Why we use affiliate links</h2>
          <p>
            Affiliate commissions help support the operation of this website, including research, writing, editing, and maintaining up-to-date travel guides.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to provide helpful, structured travel information that allows you to make informed decisions. 
            Affiliate partnerships allow us to continue publishing free content.
          </p>

          <h2>Editorial independence</h2>
          <p>
            Our recommendations are based on independent research, structured comparison, and practical decision-making criteria.
          </p>

          <p>
            Compensation does not influence our editorial judgments. We aim to present clear trade-offs, pros and cons, and relevant planning considerations.
          </p>

          <h2>Affiliate programs</h2>
          <p>

            <li>Cruise booking partners</li>
            <li>Car rental platforms</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Specific partners may change over time as we refine booking options and improve the user experience.
          </p>

          <h2>Your trust matters</h2>
          <p>
